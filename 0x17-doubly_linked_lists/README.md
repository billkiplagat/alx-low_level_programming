# Doubly Linked List Project

This project is a demonstration and implementation of a Doubly Linked List in C. It provides a set of functions to manipulate and operate on a doubly linked list data structure.



## Introduction

A Doubly Linked List is a data structure that consists of a collection of nodes, where each node contains a value and two pointers: one pointing to the previous node and another pointing to the next node. This arrangement allows for efficient traversal in both directions.

This project provides a comprehensive implementation of a Doubly Linked List, including basic operations such as inserting nodes at the beginning, at the end, or at a specified position, deleting nodes, searching for a value, and displaying the contents of the list.

## Features

- Insertion of nodes at the beginning, end, or a specific position in the list.
- Deletion of nodes from the list.
- Searching for a specific value in the list.
- Displaying the contents of the list.
- Handling edge cases, such as an empty list or operations on an invalid position.

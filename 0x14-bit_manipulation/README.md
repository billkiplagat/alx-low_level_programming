# **Bit Manipulation Projects**

This repository contains a collection of projects focused on bit manipulation. The projects in this repository provide solutions to common bit manipulation problems including converting binary to numbers, printing binary representation of a number, returning a value of a bit at a given index, setting the value of a bit to 1 at a given index, setting the value of a bit to 0 at a given index, and returning the number of bits needed to flip to get from one number to another.
Projects

Binary to Number
This project provides a function that converts a binary string to its decimal equivalent. The function takes a string of 1s and 0s as input and returns the decimal equivalent of that binary number.

Print Binary Representation
This project provides a function that prints the binary representation of a decimal number. The function takes an integer as input and prints the binary representation of that number.

Get Bit
This project provides a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index. The function takes two inputs: a decimal number and an index (0-based) and returns the value of the bit at that index (either 0 or 1).

Set Bit
This project provides two functions that set the value of a bit at a given index. The first function sets the value of the bit to 1, while the second function sets the value of the bit to 0. Both functions take two inputs: a decimal number and an index (0-based) and return the decimal number with the bit at the specified index set to 1 or 0.

# **Bit Flip**
This project provides a function that returns the number of bits needed to flip to get from one number to another. The function takes two inputs: two decimal numbers and returns the number of bits that need to be flipped in the first number to get to the second number.
